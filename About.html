                   <p> Our florist and owner, Lizzy Godden, previously worked for a wedding planner for 5 years before starting her own business. She wanted to create a store where she could promote and sell products from other local vendors. So, when the opportunity arose in 2010 for her to own her own space, she had an amazing idea and ran with it.</p>
